# Monorepo for Restaurants List App

This monorepo contains the codebase for a Restaurants List application developed as part of a technical assessment. The project consists of a RESTful API built with Node.js for managing restaurant data, and a Next.js frontend application for displaying and interacting with the restaurant information.
